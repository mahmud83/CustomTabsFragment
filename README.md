CustomTabsFragment
==================

This library is basicly changes fragments on selection of tabs, which are based on ActionBarSherlock 
TabIndicators so you can easily modify them. And it provides a controller class that handles selection, reselection 
events on tab.
	
It was a needy to set tabbar at the bottom of the window, and ActionBarSherlock wouldn't let it so...
